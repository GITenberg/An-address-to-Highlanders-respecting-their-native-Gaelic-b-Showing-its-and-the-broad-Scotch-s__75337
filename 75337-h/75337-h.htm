<p class="indent5">Aware of your great powers, I stand before your bar
to plead, that ye may plead for my countrymen, that they may be
taught first to read their mother tongue, which would not only be
the most rational, but also the most natural way of teaching them.</p>

<p>What an encouragement would it be to children to find their
mother tongue in their lessons—the very words they heard from her
lips and their playmates. How different from groping their way in
the dark, in reading a language they know nothing about. In the
former case their judgment would not only be in exercise, but
would also assist and help to keep them right; whereas in the latter
case their judgment would give them no aid, the whole depending
upon their memory.</p>

<p>Were they thus taught first to read the Gaelic, and then to commence
with the English alphabet and the English pronunciation,
and when reading, to translate every word into Gaelic, it would
not only exercise their memory, but their judgment also, and
encourage them to persevere, seeing they were enabled to master
the difficulties, being aided by one another as well as by the teacher.</p>

<p>Is there no native Scotchman also that will stand at your bar to
plead for his mother tongue? Is that not the tongue, gentlemen,
that many of you heard from your mother’s lips, and that soothed you
in the days of your childhood? And ought you not to have the
natural instinct to plead for it yourselves?—to plead that the
Broad Scotch should be the first language taught in every part of
Scotland, except where the Gaelic is spoken; and when they could
read their mother tongue, to commence at once with the English
alphabet and the English pronunciation, and when reading it to
translate every word into broad Scotch, such as <i>have</i>, hae; <i>so</i>, sae;
<i>of</i>, o’; <i>with</i>, wi, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Before the time of the singing of birds shall ever dawn upon
Scotland, the Scotch must not only return to their native tongue
but to their native melodies also. Is it not a fact that there are no
songs listened to in the city of London with so much pleasure as
the Scotch. I would not be surprised although the native language
and the native melodies of Scotland are destined to give songs of
praise to every part of the world where the English language is
spoken.</p>

<h1>ADDRESS TO HIGHLANDERS.</h1>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My Fellow-Countrymen</span>,</p>

<p class="indent5">I lately considered it my duty to address the
Highland Proprietors on a subject which has been most painful
to us all, namely, on “Highland Clearances,”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and the same spirit
which urged me to write that address, urges me to write the
present. A lover of my country I am, and ever have been; and
if there is anything more than another that is peculiar to my
native country which I love, it is the language. It was the
language that gave us a name, and that made us to differ from
the rest of Scotland. If there is anything more than another that
makes me feel proud as a man, it is this: that the Gaelic is my
native tongue, and the Highlands of Scotland my native country.
A language more glittering with a refined imagination than the
former, and a country more glittering with the same than the
latter, in the names given to the different places, is not, I believe,
to be found on earth. I am also a great lover of the native
melodies of my country. I am aware that many of a serious turn
of mind, not putting a distinction between songs and the melodies
accompanying them, have been led to look upon them as something
bad, calling them cursed songs and cursed bagpipes. But they
might as well call the Gaelic by the same name, because wicked
men use it for a bad purpose. The Gaelic may be used for a good
purpose, and so may these beautiful melodies. There are many
who use instruments of music in their parlours for a good purpose,
and why might not the bagpipes be used in the same way? Any
music that surpasses the melody of the bagpipes, in a Highland
glen, resounding from rocks, I have never listened to. I am sorry
that the old beautiful melodies of the Highlands are only to be
found now, in most places, amongst the aged, and that the young
race have lost them almost entirely. As the friend of our race, I
would say to them: Gather them all up, that none of them be lost.
You can scarcely leave a better inheritance for your children. I
would willingly part with everything I have in the world to be in
possession of them.</p>

<p>Do not suppose that when a man becomes a Christian he ceases
to be a patriot—a lover of his country. No doubt he ceases to be
a lover of everything sinful peculiar to his countrymen, but I have
no idea of that religion that would make a man cease to be a man.
Did the great Apostle of the Gentiles ever forget that he was a
Hebrew of the Hebrews? No doubt he renounced it as the foundation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of his hope before God, but to the latest day of his life he
never forgot it. The highest degree of patriotism that ever existed
in the soul of man existed in his great heart. Hear his language:
“I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing
me witness in the Holy Ghost, that I have great heaviness and
continual sorrow in my heart, for I could wish that myself were
accursed from Christ [was willing to be appointed by Christ to
suffering and death, if by that means he could save his countrymen.—<i>Barnes</i>],
for my brethren and kinsmen according to the flesh.”
<i>Romans</i> ix. 1-3. Did religion drive away patriotism from the
hearts of Jeremiah, Daniel, and Nehemiah? No; instead of that,
it made them patriots in the highest sense of the term.</p>

<p>As a lover of my country, I cannot but be grieved to see the
Gaelic dying away in many parts. In several districts where,
thirty or forty years ago, the great body of the people remained
after the English service, now the great body of the people retire.
In those districts where Buchanan’s, Grant’s, and M’Gregor’s poems
were read and sung, now the great body of the people cannot read
a word of them; and as for their beautiful airs, they have lost them
almost entirely. This has arisen, no doubt, from the youth not
having been taught to read it in their schools; and the reason of
that again is, that it is generally considered as a barrier in the way
of their education. Parents wish to make scholars of their children,
and they think the best way to do so is by renouncing the Gaelic
altogether. This, I have no hesitation in saying, is a false, and
quite an erroneous view of the subject. The Germans, the greatest
scholars in the world—I have been told that the first language
which many of them study is the Gaelic; and I can tell those
parents who wish to make scholars of their children, by all means
to give them a good English education, but never, never lay aside
the Gaelic, but have them well grounded in it. Where is the man
that ever attempted to acquire the knowledge of Latin, Greek, or
Hebrew, that did not feel how greatly he was aided in doing so by
a knowledge of it? Were one to see two boys at school together
enjoying equal advantages, the one having the Gaelic and the other
not, he would generally see the Highlander actually rising above
his fellow; and I believe that were Highlanders to enjoy equal
advantages with others, they would be found generally rising
above their fellows at college. Were there two brothers of equal
talents—the one to neglect the Gaelic entirely, and to commence
with the English, then Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and the other
with greater patience, while engaged with the English, to have
himself well grounded in the Gaelic, and then, although more tardy
and apparently behind his brother, to commence with Latin, Greek,
and Hebrew, he would in the long run fairly outstrip his brother.
It has been remarked that, in the time of the Peninsular war, none
in the British army could more readily hold intercourse with the
inhabitants than the Highland regiments. The Governor of Auckland,
New Zealand, is a Highlander, and the reason why he succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
to that honourable post was because he was enabled to
act as an interpreter between the British and the natives. How
was he so successful? His knowledge of the Gaelic accounts for it.</p>

<p>Another thing that has a tendency to do away with the Gaelic
is because individuals from the low country are getting in amongst
them, and as they find the people able to converse with them, they
do not put themselves to the trouble of acquiring a knowledge of
their language. I would not wish my countrymen to act uncivilly
towards such, yet I think they might show them at least that they
respect their own language; and as they have chosen the Highlands
as their place of residence, they would also choose their language
as their own. I have known many who could not speak one
word of Gaelic, and who in a short time could speak it quite well.</p>

<p>Another thing that has a tendency to do away with the Gaelic,
is, that many Highland ministers marry wives who cannot speak
one word of Gaelic. Their children, especially their daughters,
follow the mother, and not one word of Gaelic is spoken in the
family, nothing but genteel pure English. So that the man, however
hearty a Highlander he might have been, is fairly vanquished
in his own house. He loses heart in the Gaelic; not accustomed
to speak it in his family, he loses his relish to preach in it. He gets
careless about it in his sermons, in the school, and in the whole
parish; and perhaps whispers in the ears of some that it is in vain
attempting to keep it up, and that it is as well that it should die a
natural death. The daughters are no doubt taught music and
drawing, and, of course, French, but not one word of Gaelic, which
is considered too vulgar for young Misses. And these the daughters
of a Highland clergyman—a Gaelic preaching minister! Tell it
not in London, publish it not in the streets of Paris, lest the
daughters of the former rejoice, lest the daughters of the latter
triumph. I think that a minister’s wife should be humble, and so
condescending as that when she enters the manse she should
provide herself with Munro’s Grammar and M’Alpine’s Dictionary,
and with the aid of her husband and female servants, to master the
Gaelic, which would be more to her credit than—while their union
lasted—to be in the habit of leaving her pew, and retiring with the
genteel, the fashionable, and the gay, when her husband was about
to commence the Gaelic service; proving to a demonstration that
she had no great regard either for himself or for the truths which
he preached.</p>

<p>It has a tendency likewise to do away with the Gaelic that the
genteel, the polite, and the fashionable do not speak it. Genteel!
That man does not deserve the name of a Highland gentleman who
does not speak, not only the English, but the Gaelic properly. It
is true that there are many Highland proprietors going about
through the country dressed in the Highland garb, who cannot
speak one sentence properly in the Gaelic. Were I to meet any
such I think I would be disposed to give them the following salutation:—“I
am glad, sir, to see you in that dress, but how dare you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
wear that kilt without speaking the Gaelic?” Were these gentlemen
to know the commanding influence which the Gaelic would give
them in the affection and esteem of the people, and how their very
names would be cherished by them, not only during their life-time,
but embalmed after their death, they would consider it a perquisite
to a Highland proprietor to speak the Gaelic. If there is an individual
on earth that I would be disposed to envy, he is a Highland
proprietor who speaks the Gaelic, who appears among his tenants,—not
as the haughty lord, not as the sectarian bigot, not as the
foreigner, not in his representative, the factor—but in his precious
self; as the warm-hearted, the noble, the homely Highland gentleman.
The command of such a man would move the whole country,
because he who gave it had a place in the affections of the inhabitants.
His threatenings would have a greater influence in keeping
down roguery than all the police in the world, and his frown would
be more dreaded than transportation for life. There was a very
touching account given in the <i>Perthshire Advertiser</i> of the late John
Stewart Menzies, Esq., of Chestill, not more touching than true.
I know the thrill of delight it spread, not only amongst his own
tenants, but over the whole country, when it was known that he
would not allow his servants to speak anything to his children but
the Gaelic. I remember seeing him upwards of twenty years ago,
when in the prime of manhood—the day that the Queen arrived at
Taymouth Castle. The impression is still fresh upon my mind,—the
noble appearance of the man dressed in the Highland garb,
the sonorous sound of his voice as he addressed the Highlanders in
Gaelic, requesting them to give three hearty cheers, so loud as to
be heard at Benmore (a mountain upwards of twenty miles distant.)
He gave a similar address in English, but it made no impression
on me compared with the Gaelic. There was a majestic tone that
accompanied the Gaelic which the English could not imitate. The
Breadalbane Gaelic is the most appropriate that could be used from
the lips of commanding officers of any in the Highlands. I could
easily conceive what a powerful effect an address from a Chieftain
would have over his clan in ancient times.</p>

<p>I know that we have been accustomed to look upon ourselves as
a sociable and warm-hearted race, and to look upon our neighbours
as cold-hearted. Now, the Lowland Scotch are anything but cold-hearted;
they are also warm-hearted; but compared with us they
are cold—at least we think them so. We cannot be called a cruel
people; no doubt there are such among us—it is not our characteristic.
We cannot be called proud or haughty. There is a good
deal of that amongst us, but it is generally confined to a certain
class, and more in the west than in the east—it is not our characteristic.
We cannot be called a deceitful race; there is certainly
too much of that amongst us, but it is not universal, it is confined
to certain individuals. I have known some long-headed fellows
amongst us, as perfectly up to the art of deception as any I have
ever seen—still it is not our characteristic. Revenge cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
called the characteristic of Highlanders. Revengeful certainly they
are, and perhaps as much so as any in Britain, so that I cannot, I
dare not say that revenge may not be characteristic of some of them—still
it is not their characteristic. This then is the characteristic
of our race—<i>a warm-hearted Highlander</i>. I know, without fear of
contradiction, that this will find a response in every mind that knows
them properly. It is also characteristic of the native Irish. If
Robert Burns saw that nasty thing amongst us which he called
“Hieland pride,” he saw something else that caught his attention,
namely, “a Hieland Welcome;” and what can that be but the welcome
that the warm-hearted give to their friends. I know a young lad
who was in a certain glen for a week in search of sheep who had
wandered. He was in many a house, but in none of them did they
ask him “Had he dined?” No such questions were put, but in every
house they put meat on the table, and urged him with a heartiness
peculiar to themselves, to partake of it. Now, I ask, where in
Scotland or in England would a man meet with such warm-hearted
hospitality. The same lad was in a house at another time, where
the wife was a Baptist, who asked him, “Have you breakfasted?”
He reasoned with himself—If I say “No,” it will be the same as
asking my breakfast, so he said “Yes.” The consequence was that
he was that day in the hills without breakfast, well chastised for
telling a falsehood. But was the good woman to be justified after
all; ought she not to have entered more into the feelings of bashful
youth. I know two ministers who were in a certain glen preaching
the Gospel together. The one a Highlander, the other asked him
two or three times, “Where shall we rest all night?” The other had
no anxiety on the subject, knowing that the difficulty would be how
to refuse invitations, answered, “Do you see that slated house on
the other side of the river?” “Yes,” he replied. “Well, I do not
know who is there, but if we get no other place we’ll go there.”</p>

<p>Now, a warm heart is one of the most agreeable features of
human nature. Whatever a man may have, if this be awanting in
him, he is destitute of that which would render him an object of
affection. A man may be wise, shrewd, clever, intelligent, patient,
and even sincere; but if he has not a warm heart, he is destitute
of the brightest ornament that can adorn his nature. Now, I ask,
what is it that gives us this feature in our character? Is it because
we entered into the world with kinder dispositions than others?
I have no idea of that. I believe it is our Gaelic that has done it.
Whether it was our warm hearts that gave us the Gaelic, or the
Gaelic that gave us the warm hearts, is a difficult question. The
influence, I believe, has been mutual. And I am certain, if there
is a language upon earth that might be called the language of a
warm-hearted people, it is the Gaelic. So that, as a race, we have
received our shape from the mould into which we have been cast, by
the lips of our fond mothers pouring the eloquence of their affectionate
souls into our tender minds. I have known mothers in the Highlands,
who could speak the English as well as any in Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
who, when their children, being hurt, came crying to them, would
fling away their grammatical English as quite unsuited for the
occasion, and begin to address them in the endearing epithets of
the Gaelic, which alone could express their feelings.</p>

<p>Let any person compare the endearing epithets in the Gaelic
with those in the English, and even in the broad Scotch, which is
far in advance of the English in that respect, and he cannot but
see how far short they come. They are few in the English—“love,”
“my love;” “dear,” “my dear;” “darling,” “my darling.” They
are not only few, but they are entirely without melody. There is no
melody in “love:” the lips are closed in pronouncing it, and entirely
exclude melody. “Dear” is equally destitute of melody: it ends
with the driest, and the letter that has the least melody in the whole
alphabet. “Darling” is not so bad, but comparatively has no melody.
Now, to say that melody has no effect upon the human mind the
whole world would contradict. It is a principle of nature’s teaching,
that melody affects the human mind. The English language
is artificial, and not the language of nature, and consequently is
entirely without melody.</p>

<p>Let these endearing epithets be put into the lips of that
enchantress, the Scotchwoman, who sets to music almost everything
that passes through her fingers:—“Love,” “lovie,” “my
lovie;” “dear,” “dearie,” “my dearie;” “my wee darling,” “my
darling petty,” “my darling Johnnie;” “my wee lammie,” “my
darling lammie;” “my sweetie,” “my sweet babie.” There is
melody for you that would charm the very adders. Ah! but it is
vulgar. “They are sour, they are sour,” said the fox, when he
could not reach at the grapes. It is vulgar when the pride of a
refined style of pure English prevents many from using it. If there
is vulgarity in it, it is such as the English language cannot produce—not
indeed, on account of its vulgarity, but on account of its
true refinement.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to the endearing epithets in the Gaelic, and
we shall find them towering as high above the English and the
broad Scotch as our Highland mountains tower high above theirs.
<i>Gradh</i>, <i>a ghraidh</i> (love, my love), the <i>dh</i> almost silent; <i>a ghraidh</i>
is equally strong with “my love,” and full of melody; <i>gaol</i>, <i>a ghaoil</i>
(love, my love, or dear, my dear). “<i>Ghaoil, a ghaoil, do na fearaibh</i>,”
(M’Lachlan), the most endearing expression which could come from
the lips of man, which the English cannot imitate, and which it is
impossible properly to translate. The nearest approach that can
be made to it—“Thou dearest, or most beloved, or most loving of
men.” How touching <i>Mo ghaolan</i>, <i>mo ghaolag</i>, the former the
diminutive masculine, the latter the diminutive feminine, the <i>an</i>
being the sign of the one and the <i>ag</i> the sign of the other, and
being the same as in broad Scotch affectionate. <i>Cheist</i>, <i>a cheist</i>,
<i>mo cheist</i>, <i>mo cheistean</i>, <i>mo cheisteag</i> (the question, thou art the
question, thou art my question, thou art my wee question, boy or
girl). What is the question with the fond mother? What shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
I do with my child? How shall I comfort him? How shall I
make him happy? <i>Eudail</i>, <i>m’ eudail</i>, <i>m’ eudail bheag</i>—(thou art
property, thou art my property, thou art my wee property). <i>Eudail</i>
literally means cattle or property of any kind. <i>Run</i> literally means
intention, secret, disposition, inclination, regard; but when used as
an endearing epithet, it is the strongest in any language, and means
an object where all the desires and affections of the soul meet as
in a focus, an object on which they are fixed.</p>

the lips of mothers, and are still more powerful when they come
from the lips of a father:—<i>O! a ruin, gabh mo chomhairle</i> (O my

mo bhalachan runach</i> (My wee loving boy); <i>Mo chaileag runach</i> (My
wee loving girl). We have another word, which is the sweetest in
the language and full of melody, <i>Luaidh</i>, the <i>dh</i> being almost
silent. It literally means “mention,” “to make mention;” but when
used as a noun it means “a beloved person,” “an object of praise,”
“an object on which to expatiate or to talk about by way of praise.”
How powerful from the lips of parents or friends—<i>Mo luaidh, a
luaidh nan gillean</i> (thou dearest of lads); <i>a luaidh nan nighean</i> (thou
dearest of girls).</p>

<p>It adds greatly to the force of these epithets when used along
with <i>mo chridhe</i> (my heart), as <i>a ghraidh</i>, <i>a ghaoil</i>, <i>a cheist</i>, <i>eudail</i>, <i>a
run</i>, <i>a luaidh mo chridhe</i>. Any one of these epithets used along with
<i>mo chridhe</i>, from the lips of an affectionate mother, is as much calculated
to soften the heart, and to bring tears from the eyes, as
any sounds that can come from the lips of a human being. And
equally strong, if not more so, <i>a laoidh mo chridhe</i> (thou calf of my
heart). Do not laugh at us, ye Lowland mothers—ye have your
ain “wee lammies,” and we have our ain “wee calfies,” and recollect
that our calfies are bonnier than yours. And, besides, I suppose
it is seldom you give milk to the ewe’s lammies; that is not,
however, the case with our mammies—they frequently give milk to
the cow’s calfies, and hence it cannot but occur to them that each
has a calfie of her own to give milk to. The proper pronunciation
of this word is impossible for an Englishman to come to, and might
be called the shibboleth. There is no sound in the Gaelic that has
more of that melody that subdues and softens. The tongue has
scarcely anything to do but merely to touch the upper teeth in pronouncing
the <i>l</i>, and then to withdraw, and, remaining passive, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
sound is made by the gullet, and is as if it proceeded from the
heart.</p>

<p>For “my sweet lammie,” we have <i>m’uanan</i>, <i>m’uanag mhilis</i>, masculine
and feminine. For “darling,” “my darling,” we have <i>chiall</i>,
<i>mo chiallan</i>, <i>mo chiallag</i>—both in the diminutive masculine and
feminine; and let it be borne in mind that the diminutive in the
Gaelic is expressive of affection like the broad Scotch. For “kind,”
“kindness,” we have <i>caoimhneas</i>, <i>caoimhneil</i>, full of melody. But
we have also <i>caoin</i> (kind), which is taken from the verb <i>caoineadh</i>
(weeping). We know that weeping is generally expressive of kindness.
It is very extraordinary that <i>guil</i> (to weep), is taken from
<i>guth shuil</i> (the voice of the eyes). There is another word still, and
equally melting, and more soothing to the feelings, <i>caomh</i> (kind),
<i>caomhail</i> (kindly), <i>caomhach</i> (a kind person), <i>caomhan</i>, <i>caomhag</i>, masculine
and feminine diminutive. <i>Mo dhuine caomh</i> (my kind man),
the most endearing expression that can come from the lips of a
woman to her husband. I have never had the pleasure of listening
to the endearing epithets expressive of the maternal feelings of a
Northumberland, a Yorkshire, or an Essex mother; but I am pretty
certain that nature has supplied them with something more expressive
of their feelings than the English language can do.</p>

<p>Ye Lowland Scotch, look at our language! Many surly critics
amongst you have hitherto been listening to it with the ear, and
looking at it with the scowling eye of contempt. Look at it again—look
at it aright, and that contempt will give place to admiration!
Ye refined, ye learned Englishmen, enter this our vale of Athol
through the Highland mouth’s paradise, Dunkeld; not with railway
speed, but at your leisure. Let your ears be charmed with the
melody of our groves, and let your cold hearts be warmed with
the comforts of our Highland homes.</p>

<p>Now, my countrymen, look at your own language. Have you
any cause to be ashamed of it? Have you not cause rather to be
proud of it, and even to bless God for giving you such a language?
Would you wish to renounce that language, so expressive of the
kindest feelings of the heart, and which has made us what we are—a
warm-hearted, sociable race? Would you wish to renounce it,
and to receive in its place the language taught in your schools?
Should you ever do so, let me tell you that you will renounce your
warm hearts along with it—both shall be buried in the same grave
together, and you will make but a very poor exchange; as poor,
as if you passed from sunny France to Greenland, the land of snow
and frost. The language taught in your schools is for the head,
but not for the heart—for the understanding, not for the soul;
yes, for the mental faculties, not for the affections. And as such
study it; you will never be great scholars without a knowledge of
it; it is essential to obtaining the knowledge of the different
branches of education. But let it never be the language of your
firesides, of your parlours, of your social gatherings. The language
taught in your schools is the language of scholars, of learned men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
(these dry mortals); and may be called the language of art, or an
artificial language. But your language is the language of nature,
of affectionate parents, kind-hearted companions, of your countrymen;
and while speaking it you act as natural a part as the sheep
in bleating.</p>

<p>Men’s great effort in the present time is to do away, not only
with the Highland Gaelic, but also with the Provincial dialects in
Scotland and in England; and to substitute in their place pure
English. All are drilled with the same grammars—regulated by the
same vocabularies, without one word but proper English; and every
word to be pronounced with the same accuracy. This is what they
aim at, and rejoice in their success; and are apt to pity those poor
creatures that are not willing to be ruled by them. Well, should
they be successful and reach the summit of their ambition, to which
they no doubt look forward with pleasure; when they shall get
every man, woman, and child, from John o’ Groat’s to Land’s End,
under the sway of pure English, and, standing on the highest pinnacle
of the pyramid which they have reared, what shall they
behold? One universal, uniform level. No rising ground, no
elevated spots, no sloping eminences, no ranges of mountains to
relieve the mind and please the eye. Should they be successful,
instead of being a source of rejoicing to them, they would have a
greater cause to weep over the havoc they have made in the
beautiful variety of nature; more resembling the work of locusts
than of rational men. Man’s great effort is uniformity, perfect
uniformity. God’s method is variety. Which the most glorious—man’s
uniformity or God’s variety? The former like the work of
a man, the latter like the work of a God. The former would sicken
my soul, the latter would put me in ecstasy. And the same effort
is made by all the different denominations of Christians. Uniformity
of creed and of worship is their great aim and wish; and the more
successful they are, the more they are pleased with themselves.
But by persevering in the course they are taking, never, never shall
they reach millennial glory. Before they shall reach that, they
must not only give over their present attempt, but retrace their
steps, and rest satisfied with God’s method of a glorious variety.
In this way, and in this way alone, shall God’s people be properly
united, and enjoy one another.</p>

<p>Who is not delighted with the different varieties of Gaelic spoken
in the Highlands? Is it not much more agreeable than were the
whole under the sway of our standard Gaelic. The same words
used, the same pronunciation, the same tones everywhere; which
would make the whole Highlands, as regards the Gaelic, a perfect
level. Whereas, in its present state, there is a variety of scenery
to relieve the mind—towering mountains here and there.</p>

<p>There Ben Nevis lifting its head above the rest, as if bidding
defiance to the whole for having the best Gaelic. That was the
native place of M’Lachlan, one of the best Gaelic scholars that
ever lived, and a first-rate poet too. The Fort-William people may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
ascend the top of Ben Nevis with the elegy that he composed to
Professor Beattie, Aberdeen, and defy, not only the English, but
even the broad Scotch to produce its equal. The air of that piece
is one of the most plaintive that ever I have listened to, being the
air of that old song called “The Massacre of Glencoe.”</p>

<p>Ben Cruachan, again, at the other end of that range of magnificent
mountains, representing the mainland of Argyleshire. And
although it may not vie with the other in point of height, it may
surpass it in point of rich pasture, and be almost its equal in point
of an extensive survey from its summit.</p>

<p>Ben Lawers represents the Breadalbane Gaelic, <i>a’ chainnt shocrach,
choir</i>. Some consider it too drawling; yet I am delighted with it,
being the best suited and the most appropriate that could come
from the lips of a Breadalbanite. They are the best people for
being heard in the distance that I know. A person would be
almost led to think they acquired that habit by their forefathers
having been accustomed to talk with one another across Loch Tay.</p>

<p><i>Si-chailinn</i>, again, representing the Glenlyon, the Strathtummel,
and the Rannoch Gaelic, which I believe is a corruption of “<i>Ciche
chailinn</i>.” Our Lowland neighbours have retained the sense, “The
Maiden’s pap.” Rannoch has perhaps the best Gaelic in Perthshire.</p>

<p><i>Benaglo</i> represents the Blair Athol and the Strathardle Gaelic.
May a race ever surround it that will understand</p>

<p><i>Beinn a bhrachdaidh</i> represents the Athol Gaelic, rich in pasture,
noble in appearance; but let it take care of a colony forming at
its base, that they will not undermine it and blow it up. Pitlochrie
is extending its cottages, filled with foreigners. May it ever be a
source of protection to the Atholites from the cold northern blasts
of the language taught in their schools.</p>

<p><i>Ghlaismhaol</i>, on whose summit the three counties of Perth, Forfar,
and Aberdeen meet, we may almost score out of our list, as it
has almost deserted us.</p>

<p><i>Benmacdui</i>, representing the Badenoch and the Braemar Gaelic;
but let it take care that it will not be in the descending scale.</p>

<p><i>Beinn Bhiogair</i>, in Islay, raises its head as high as it can, representing
the Islay Gaelic, which is certainly good. The females in
Islay, with the exception of those in North Uist, are the sweetest
speakers of Gaelic that I know. Islay is the native place of
M’Alpine, the author of the pronouncing dictionary, which is very
good, only there are a few words with the Islay pronunciation
which do not suit other places.</p>

<p><i>’Bheinnmhor</i>, in Mull, raises its head high, and so it may, for its
Gaelic is excellent. Its inhabitants speak it generally with great
correctness and fluency. But I am not sure if it can look down
upon all its neighbours. There is an island beyond it, namely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
Tiree, which, though it has no large mountains like those in Mull
to boast of, still the few it has are beautiful, and green to the top,
whose inhabitants are amongst the prettiest and the most fluent
speakers in the Highlands. They have no tone whatever like many
others, and it is seldom they commit a grammatical blunder; their
very peculiarities are pretty; a person would be almost led to think
that they are born grammarians. A boy six or eight years of age
might teach grammar to one-third of the Highland population.
Their only fault is having too many English words in their vocabulary.
As this is not a fault peculiar to the Tiree people, I would
caution Highlanders against the practice. If they can find a Gaelic
word to suit the purpose, why use an English word? I have known
Highlanders that had dogs, and that disdained to call them by an
English name, or to speak one word to them in English, and who
pitied those poor fellows that thought their dogs could not be
taught to answer in Gaelic.</p>

<p><i>Chuillinn Sgiathanach</i>, the chief mountain in Skye, raising its head
aloft as if saying, “We have the best Gaelic in the Highlands.” Certainly
they have good Gaelic, and they speak it in a way peculiar
to themselves, which is delightful to listen to, but still no one but a
simpleton would attempt to imitate them.</p>

<p><i>Hough mor</i>, South Uist (<i>Hough</i> means mountain), raises its head
as if determined not to be behind the rest; and so it may, for it is
second to no other place in the Highlands. As for Lewes, it is
like a kingdom by itself. There we have the only individual that
attempted to write the history of Scotland in Gaelic. Thanks to
him for his effort. May he not be disappointed in his expectation.
Let my countrymen show that they appreciate his labours, by
putting themselves in possession of his work. Should he publish a
second edition, the names of places, I think, would be better as
they are in English, or, if translated, to be put in the margin. As
there is a good deal of provincialism in the Gaelic of Lewes, I
think, in writing, it would be better if possible to follow our standard
of Gaelic.</p>

<p>As I have never been in Sutherlandshire, nor on the mainland
of Ross and Inverness-shires, I am not prepared to speak from
personal knowledge of the various shades of difference there, resembling
their chief mountains; but I know there are differences.
Let each class not be ashamed of their own peculiarity. It is the
language of their nature, and they act according to their nature
when they speak it. For a Ross-shire man to attempt to imitate
an Argyleshire man would make him ridiculous, and for the latter
to attempt to imitate the former would make him equally so. I
have known men who, when they sold their stirks, spoke their own
language, but when engaged in prayer to God, spoke in the language
and tones of Ross-shire. Are they so stupid as not to know
that it is not to the tones of the voice that God will listen, but to
the earnest pleadings of believing hearts? There are several districts
in the Highlands where the Gaelic has sadly degenerated;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
their best plan would be to get teachers from those parts where it
is not so.</p>

<p>The great object, then, at present is not only to do away with
our Gaelic in all its beautiful variety, but to do away with the
broad Scotch in all its beautiful variety likewise, and to establish
upon their ruins pure English. Now, I have not one word to say
against the English. I admire it as the best that could be used
for our halls of learning, for discussing any public question, and
for handling any intricate subject. But I must declare that it has
a baneful effect on society. It is the worst language that could be
used for parents, children, brothers, sisters, companions, and for the
social gathering. Being an artificial language, it makes society so
too. It has a tendency to puff them up with pride. Instead of
making them pliable, it makes them stiff; distant and reserved
instead of being homely; unnatural instead of natural; unsociable
instead of sociable; and instead of making them easy, imposes its
own yoke of ceremonial bondage upon its votaries; and I have no
hesitation in affirming, without fear of contradiction, that pure English,
instead of regenerating society, has the contrary effect. It is
probable that I may be sneered at for so affirming, but it will remain
a fact when the sneering is over, and will yet be acknowledged
when I am dead and laid in the grave. Let any person seriously
consider the fearful havoc it has made, not only in the Highlands,
but also in our large cities. It has divided society into two—the
refined and the vulgar; the genteel and the homely; the upper and
the lower class; the select and the common. What has it made of
the most of our Highland proprietors? Are they what they used
to be, the men of the people, standing on a common level with them
in speaking their native Gaelic? No, they are now as if they were
a race of foreigners amongst them, high up above their heads,
without any sympathy with them, disdaining to speak one word to
them but in pure English. It has likewise a baneful effect on the
middle class of society, those who aspire after it, who put themselves
amongst “the would-be genteel,” who in the pride of their
hearts, although they can speak Gaelic, deny that they can, and
become ashamed of it at home and abroad. The consequence is,
that when the English sermon is over, they must retire with the
genteel and the fashionable, and disdain to remain amongst a company
of vulgar Highlanders, listening to a vulgar discourse in Gaelic.
To what shall I compare these “would-be gentlemen and ladies?”
Shall I compare them to the vain peacock showing his beautiful
tail, or to the ass showing its long ears? I think I will compare
them to both. There they are retiring as if saying, “See what
beautiful tails we have got.” “O yes, yes,” might those within say
to them, “we see them, we see them, but we see your long ears
likewise.”</p>

<p>Were there a discourse in broad Scotch delivered in the Lowlands
after the superfine English, depend upon it your fine
ladies and gentlemen would retire all in a band before their ears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
would be horrified by its sweet melody, and it would be a first-rate
excuse to pretend that they had lost their broad Scotch.</p>

<p>You are in danger also, not from the chains and slavery of proud
Edward’s power, but from another quarter you never suspect,
namely, the <i>Dominie’s tawse</i>. Take care that he’ll not rob you of
your wifies, weans; your Johnnies, Tammies, Willies; your Jessies,
Katies, and Betsies; yes, your bonnie lammies, and from many other
wee bits o’ things which you hae tingling about your hearths, and
around your affections, which make you so sociable and happy, and
moreover gives you such unparalleled tongues for melody and music.
Again, as your friendly neighbour, I say take care.</p>

<p>I am convinced, that were the broad Scotch mixed with an
English vocabulary, and pronounced as it is generally by educated
Scotsmen, we would have a language for all the purposes of life,
far surpassing the pure English, and which, instead of it being our
envy, ours would actually be the envy of Englishmen. Such a
language would not only give us clear heads, but also warm hearts;
would not only be the best for the higher departments of literature,
but the best for our homes, as husbands and wives, parents and
children, brothers and sisters; for friends; and in the social circle;
and put us in possession of lyric poetry, such as the English
language has not, and never can produce. It is most extraordinary
that intelligent well educated Scotsmen never attempt to speak
their own language but when they wish to be humorous. Now,
that really implies that they see something pretty in it after all, but
that what is fashionable and customary amongst educated men prevents
them from using it but for such a purpose. But I think that
the pretty thing should not be altogether laid aside, but freely used,
not merely for making the social circle smile, but also for warming
their hearts, and making each feel that he is quite at home—in an
honest, homely, cheerful Scotsman’s home.</p>

<p>How highly would I esteem that learned professor who, after
delivering his lecture to the students in pure English, would no
sooner leave his professional chair, and meet his friend, than he
would salute him, not as the learned professor, but as the homely
Scotsman;—that when he would enter his own dwelling and sit at
the head of his family, he would appear there in the same garb, and
would set an example before his children, not so much for correct
speaking as for affability, kindness, and homeliness of manner;—who,
when he would appear in the social circle, would be its life and
soul—not indeed as the learned professor, but as the man of feeling,
of intelligence, and of sociality. Is it not a known fact that great
learning in a sermon actually destroys its effect, and that great
scholarship in a man eclipses the affectionate friend, the social companion.
A man brimful of learning we may admire but we cannot
love.</p>

<p>Now, such is the English, a learned language. The Scholar is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
seen almost in every sentence. I may admire it, and in doing so I
feel that it puffs me up, but love it I cannot. It is not like the
Gaelic and the broad Scotch—the language of nature—but the
language of art. In the Gaelic I see my own image reflected, but
in the English the image of the scholar. As the Gaelic reflects the
image of the Highlanders, and the broad Scotch that of the Lowlanders,
I cannot but love them. I may admire the works of art,
but love them I cannot; but the works of nature I not only admire,
but actually love them also, and I cannot but do so.</p>

<p>The English language is not only to a great extent foreign to
the Scotch people, but it is almost equally so to the great body of
the people of England; and is it not extraordinary, that before men
are considered qualified for preaching the gospel to the native inhabitants,
they must do so in a language which they do not speak,
and in a style of elocution which is not natural to them. An
Englishman’s elocution is the most unlikely for moving a Scotchman,
and far less a Highlander. I once attended an elocution class, whether
the better of it or not I cannot say; but one day in the Highlands
I opened the door and saw a woman within twenty yards, beyond a
dyke—the upper part of the body only seen, her hair dishevelled,
her hand raised, her fist shut, and scolding at a fearful rate. I
heard her tones, caught her expressions, noticed the eloquence with
which she spoke, and returned into the house, saying to myself—“It
was quite needless for me to have attended Mr Hartley’s class,
when elocution is to be found so near, and that of the right kind,
the elocution of nature.”</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that some of the Methodists are sneered at by
the Press for attempting to speak to the people in their provincialism.
Go on, ye lively Methodists; never heed their sneers. You
are doing the very thing which the Holy Ghost enabled the
Apostles to do—to speak unto men in their own tongues. I question
if the present style of preaching the Gospel will ever gain the hearts
of the Scotch people to God. And I would not be surprised
although God would show their folly to those who attempt to do
so by raising up Evangelists—men endowed with a good fund of
common sense and natural talent—men fired with zeal for the glory
of God—moved on with warm hearts and compassionate souls, who
will preach the Gospel to them in that language which is a part of
their nature and the best medium for getting at their hearts. We
know that conversion is the work of God, but when he deals with
men he uses appropriate means. He does not lay aside the natural
laws of their nature, but acts in accordance with them. When He
unlocks the door of the heart He uses a key fitted for the purpose;
and is it possible that a pure English style can be the proper key
for unlocking the heart of that man who has been accustomed all
his life long to speak broad Scotch. Had the Gospel ever such an
effect as when it was preached in the native language of the country?
There is not only an orthodox creed, but there must also be an
orthodox language and even an orthodox elocution. It is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
feared that men with their orthodoxy will allow poor sinners to go
to hell.</p>

<p>The orthodox creed, language, elocution, and even melodies, are
all artificial—the handiwork of that being man, who would be as
gods, and which are impossible to admire without being puffed up
with a vain conceit of his great powers. O! how different the
effects in admiring the handiwork of the Great Supreme as they are
seen in nature—in birds, beasts, fish, flowers, mountains, and dales,
the native languages and melodies of our races. The chattings of
Highlanders and Lowlanders to one another is as much the
language of nature as the lowing of cattle, the bleating of sheep,
and the chirping of birds. And our native melodies are as much
the melodies of nature as the singing of larks and nightingales. But
proud man must do away with them by introducing his own artificial
language and melodies, on which he puts the stamp of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The pure English has not only committed a great havoc amongst
us, both in the Highlands and Lowlands, but there is also an
Englified style accompanying it in many places which is disgusting.
Were there an English lady to settle in one of our Highland towns
she would soon be surrounded by a goodly number of mimicking
parrots. Cockneyism in Cockneydom does very well; I would almost
dance with delight to listen to it there; but Cockneyism from the
lips of a Scotchman, and far more from a Highlander, I abominate.
I have been quite ashamed of some of my own countrymen, who,
when they go South, are not satisfied with merely imitating Scotchmen,
but they must become regular Cockneys. Ah! the pride of
their hearts is contemptible. I would say to a Scotchman—if you
wish to show yourself a man, show yourself a Scotchman; and I
would say the same to a Highlander—if you also wish to show
yourself a man, show yourself a Highlander. Is an Englishman
alone to have the privilege and the honour of showing himself a
man? Is he and his artificial English to be exalted as a god in
every part of the United Kingdom? Must every knee bow and
every tongue confess to him? I declare, in the name of my countrymen,
that we shall not worship at his shrine; we shall not fall down
and worship the golden image which he has set up. As a race, we
and our language have hitherto been unjustly and contemptuously
treated. But as we have in times past made others feel that we
were alive, we shall not only make Scotland, but England also,
feel that as a race we are still alive and have a language of our
own. So that, from this time henceforward, should one Highlander
show his peacock-tail to another by addressing him in any other
language but his native Gaelic—considering it more genteel—let
him be told at once without any ceremony, <i>Tha mi ga fhaicinn, tha
mi ga fhaicinn, ach ata mi faicinn cluasan fad na h-asail mar an
ceudna</i>; and in like manner, should a Scotchman show his peacock-tail
to another by addressing him in any language but that of his
native country, let him also be told at once, “I see it, I see it, but
I see your long ears also.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>There was an individual at one time called “the Flower o’ Dumblane.”
I wonder if there was one in the present time that might
be called the Flower of Glasgow, what like would she be. I suppose
she would be good-looking, a handsome body, and good
features; I don’t say either pretty or beautiful, but good; her
expression sweet, amiable, intelligent; her manner easy, graceful,
natural; nothing awkward, nothing artificial, but the spontaneous
outflow of a kind heart, good taste, and an enlightened mind. But
how would the Flower be dressed? Of course many would answer—quite
in the fashion. I am not very sure about that; I think
quite in the fashion would disfigure the Flower. How then? Just
in such a manner as that no person would notice the dress at all,
but have the attention fixed upon the Flower, and that nothing
could be said about it but that it was befitting. But the Flower of
Glasgow would not require to be dumb, she must speak occasionally,
but in doing so would not put herself in the front rank of
speakers. She would, however, be an acute observer of what was
said and done, and should anything deserve a laugh, she would of
course give a hearty one to show her white teeth and her kind
nature. When, however, any remark was made, or any question
put to her, demanding her saying something, she would of course
speak out. Bearing in mind that she is a native of Glasgow, that
her mother was that before her, a truly Scotch woman, who spoke
the broad Scotch, but considerably refined by her intelligence and
good taste. Now, what would be her style of speaking? Many
would answer, no doubt, “In first-rate English style.” I declare
that that again would destroy the beauty of your flower. There
must be nothing artificial in a flower. The moment art lays its
hand upon it, or even touches it, its beauty fades. No doubt there
are many flowers in Glasgow, but many of them are artificial, and
differ as much from the real flower as the flowers in their shop
windows differ from those in the West End Park. There
are many Scotch parents who send their daughters to English boarding-schools
to be as perfectly Englified there as possible, but it is
the same as if they put their flowers into a hot-house in the month
of July. A flower will never show its beauty but in connection
with its parent stem; remove it from that and it fades.</p>

<p>In order that a man may be a good member of society, he must
be affable and agreeable in his manner; but he can neither be the
one nor the other unless he is homely. And how can that man be
homely who assumes an Englified style of speaking foreign to his
nature. I am aware that in certain circles to say that a man is
homely is nothing to his praise, but implies that in their estimation
he is awanting in something that would make him a better member
of society. He is too homely in his dress, in his style, in his
expressions—too homely in his manner as he sits and holds his
head, laughs and smiles; in short, he is too homely in everything.
But I wonder how they would improve the homely man. I suspect
the improvement would be something like the improvement that a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
number of drunkards would make upon a sober man. They are
intoxicated themselves with a vain conceit of a certain standard of
refinement, and they must do their best to get him intoxicated also.
In order to come up to their standard, he must make a fop of himself—must
make a fool of himself by assuming a style of speaking
not natural to him. He must sit and hold his head in the fashionable
position; if that is not its natural position, he would require
a person to sit behind him, and with a hand on each side to keep it
in the genteel position. His laughing must be all feigned, not
hearty, not natural; his smiling must be the same. In short, in
order to come up to their standard, he must make himself a regular
play-actor, a hollow hypocrite, a downright mimicking parrot. See
that female, how straight she holds her head. Is that its natural
position? Does she keep it that way at <i>hame</i>? I suspect not—there
is evidently an effort. My young woman, I am sorry for the
misery you are inflicting upon yourself. That which is generally
called refined society is a society for inflicting misery upon their
dupes, and upon their race; and the females of that society might
be called sisters of cruelty, and not “sisters of mercy.”</p>

<p>Were there a society formed for improving nature as seen in
birds and four-footed animals, I suppose all men would look upon
such as a society of fools. But a society formed for improving
nature as seen in the human species, is more highly thought of than
any society on earth. I leave wise men to judge if there is not more
of the fool in such a society than they are aware of. And the first
attempt that has been made to improve the human species in Scotland
is to do away with their native languages, which are the
languages of their nature, and which God hath given them to
make their feelings and their thoughts known to one another,
and to impose upon them a language which is foreign to their nature
and not in accordance with the feelings of their hearts. God knows
what is better for Highlanders than they know, and their best plan
is, if they would not set themselves up in opposition to him, to aid
them in obtaining more knowledge of their own language, for certainly
they will obtain the knowledge of salvation more readily
through the medium of their own than any language they can teach
them. There are various ways in which men attempt to improve
nature as seen in the human species. I would say leave them, let
them alone to be guided by their own natural instincts under the
guidance of their parents. The only improvement that ought to be
attempted is giving them spiritual instincts—to impart the knowledge
of God to them through the medium of their own language—to
make them acquainted with God’s method of saving men through
Christ—bringing them under the influence of the love of God, giving
them the hope of glory—making them to rejoice in God their
Saviour, and uniting them to Christ and to one another in love. Then
there will indeed be a refined society, with heaven’s stamp upon it—natural,
beautiful, glorious: as far above what is called refined
society as the heavens are high above the earth.</p>

<p>It is true that the Gaelic is not to be compared as a learned language
with the English, being very deficient in those technical terms
that are used in the various branches of education. But for ordinary
purposes, the Gaelic is not only equal but in many things surpasses
the English. The tongue of a Highlander surpasses any that I
have listened to for sarcasm, wit, and good humour. For showing
the good qualities of one, or the bad qualities of another, it is before
the English. For expressing sympathy with a fellow sufferer—for
the house of prayer—for the family and the social circle—for expressing
the conjugal, the parental, the filial, the brotherly, the
friendly feelings and affections of the heart, it is far in advance of
the English. For preaching the gospel, for expatiating on the
love of God, for holding forth Jesus Christ and him crucified, for
catching and keeping the attention, for reaching and searching the
conscience, and for applying the subject to the heart, I have always
preferred it; and I am convinced that those who know it properly,
and are in the habit of using it, have the same feelings. Its very
simplicity gives it a power which the English does not possess. Who
does not see that the very simplicity of Judah’s pleading with
Joseph for his brother Benjamin gave it greater force than had it
been delivered by Lord Brougham. Many of the translations
which I have seen in Gaelic are far too literal and stiff. A literal
translation will never tell on the minds of Highlanders. The best
way is to catch the ideas, and to express them as they would do
themselves.</p>

<p>What the Gaelic is capable of doing is clearly seen from the
<i>Gaelic Messenger</i> and Dr. M’Leod’s Collection, also the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>
with notes, and other works of John Bunyan, translated and
edited by Dr. M’Gilvray, Glasgow, which has not only come up to
the original, but in some things surpasses it. If <i>Good Words</i> in the
hands of the son are good, good words in the hands of the father
are not behind. Any periodical more expressive, more telling, more
touching, and more entertaining than the <i>Gaelic Messenger</i> I have
never read; and the principal reason why that periodical had not
been more extensively circulated, and why it has ceased to exist, is
the great misfortune connected with Highlanders—that the great
body of them are not taught to read the Gaelic. This misfortune
is their disgrace—the disgrace of parents—the disgrace of noblemen
and gentlemen who are native proprietors; yes, and the disgrace
of ministers and schoolmasters. Let them all awake and wipe
away the disgrace from their native country. It is with blushing
shame for my country that I have to declare that never in my
younger days did I get a single lesson in the Gaelic in any school
that I attended, and I feel the ill effects of it to this day.</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, in which the Gaelic greatly exceeds
the English, namely, in lyric poetry. From the very constitution of
the two languages the English will not even make a near approach
to it. It is capable of a great many contractions that the English is
not capable of, <i>agus</i> and <i>’us</i>, <i>’s</i>. All monosyllables and trisyllables<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
ending with <i>a</i>, or <i>e</i>, may drop the last. Such words as <i>saoghalta</i>
(worldly), <i>saoghalt</i>, <i>saogh’lt</i>; participles of verbs, such as <i>riarachadh</i>
(satisfying), <i>riarach’</i>, or <i>riar’chadh</i>; the verb to be, <i>is maith</i> (it is
good), <i>’s maith</i>; <i>bithidh</i> (will, or shall be), <i>bi’dh</i>; <i>bithibh</i> (be ye),
<i>bi’bh</i>; <i>bi thusa</i> (be thou), <i>bi’-sa</i>. But what makes the Gaelic so
superior to the English, is, not merely that it is capable of more
contractions, but as the vowels are more distinctly sounded and the
consonants less so, we are satisfied if we get the vowels to rhyme;
but that will not do in the English, the consonants must rhyme also.
The vowels in the Gaelic have only the two sounds, the short and
the long, and are pronounced as in the broad Scotch. We have
several sounds which are not in the English at all, sounds formed
by the union of two and even three vowels, which are the most
melodious in the language. Union of two vowels—<i>ao</i>, <i>gaol</i>, <i>saor</i>
(love, free); <i>ia</i>, <i>grian</i>, <i>srian</i> (sun, bridle); <i>ei</i>, <i>greine</i>, <i>srein</i> (the genitive
of sun, bridle); <i>eu</i>, <i>speur</i>, <i>neul</i> (sky, cloud); <i>ua</i>, <i>fuachd</i>, <i>shuas</i>
(cold, up); <i>ai</i>, <i>baigh</i>, <i>traigh</i> (kindness, seashore); <i>io</i>, <i>fior</i>, <i>dion</i> (true,
protection); <i>eo cleoc reota</i>, (a cloak frozen). The union of three
vowels, the sweetest sounds in the language—<i>aoi</i>, <i>aoibhneas</i> (joy);
<i>uai</i>, <i>buaidh</i> (victory). Besides these, there are many words where
<i>eu</i> may be changed into <i>ia</i>, as <i>feur</i>, <i>geur</i>, <i>neul</i> (grass, sharp, cloud),
<i>fiar</i>, <i>giar</i>, <i>nial</i>. The former is the standard Gaelic, but the latter
is more common in the west and north.</p>

<p>To translate lyric poetry from English into Gaelic is comparatively
easy, but to translate it into English is not only more difficult,
but we have many pieces which cannot be translated at all so as to
rhyme. Let any person compare our metrical version of the
Psalms of David with the English, and he cannot but see how
superior it is; and even the paraphrases, although originally composed
in English, the Gaelic not only comes up to it, but actually
surpasses it in many places. In the English, in common metre, the
last syllable of the second and fourth line only rhyme, whereas frequently
in the Gaelic the last syllable of the first, and the fourth of
the second rhyme.</p>

<p class="noindent">How smoothly and sweetly does that rhyme flow compared with
the English. I have seen a book called the <i>Highland Bards</i>, translated
by a great scholar, and although done as well as possible in a
translation, yet every one who knows Gaelic cannot fail to see how
far short it comes of the strength and beauty of the original. No man,
however great, can do an impossibility. I have also seen translations
of Dugald Buchanan’s Poems, and these by men who were
greater scholars than himself; and on looking at them, I saw as
great a change between them and the original as if I had seen
Dugald himself when in his prime, and again at seventy, when it would
be all I could do to recognise his features, but O how changed!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Taking his poem on the day of judgment, I defy the English
language to produce its equal as a piece of lyric poetry. In the
language there is scarcely a single word coined from another
language, perhaps a few from the broad Scotch that came to be
naturalized—all the language of his native country, extraordinary
for its simplicity and expressiveness. The rhyme of that poem is
smooth, it is perfect. I have attempted, or should rather say, I
have endeavoured to improve what others attempted, and the best
I could make of some of the verses I give in the following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">These are equally strong, and rhyme well, but where is the melody
compared with the Gaelic, and it is most extraordinary that I cannot
sing them without feeling that I am puffed up with the language,
whereas in the Gaelic I have no such feelings. The English will
never come up to the following, sublime in their simplicity:—</p>

awakened with the trumpet’s loudest sound.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not so far amiss, only “crush” and “leash” as it regards
the vowels, do not rhyme. Look at the Gaelic—how simple; every
word forged and hammered on the anvil of a Highlander’s method
of making his thoughts known. Consider the sublimity of the
passage. Dugald was not a classical, but one of nature’s scholars,
who had learned his lessons well, and I am certain that in learning
them he was not puffed up as they are, but rather humbled.
Thunder, one of the most awful agents conceivable. When the
thunder roars the earth keeps silence. A thunder held in the hand—how
sublime? A thousand thunders, a thousand times more so.
How are these thunders held? Like hounds restrained by the
leash. Anything more expressive could not come from the lips of
man. A hound at first sight of the game would almost choke
himself at the first spring, if restrained. Are these things so; and
how perilous the condition of those who are the enemies of the
Great Judge? The air to which that poem is sung is also most
appropriate; so that in singing it, one never thinks either of the
language or the melody, any farther than that they are expressive;
but has his mind wholly occupied with the sublime, the awful, and
the beautiful imagery presented before it. I have heard that poem
sung to a crowded audience, and I have never listened to anything
spoken or sung that had a greater effect. Every eye fixed; all
attention; awe, anxiety, concern depicted on every countenance.
And I can tell Ministers of the Gospel all over the Highlands, that
could they get two or three to sing that poem properly to their
congregations, that it would have a far greater effect than most of
their sermons. And I can tell them, moreover, that that poem
sung once had a more blessed effect than all my sermons for a
whole twelvemonth.</p>

<p>There are three poems of M’Gregors composed to suit the air of
an old song, called “<i>Gaoir nam ban Muileach</i>” (The wail of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Mull women). There are seven lines in the stanza, and the last is
repeated twice. In singing it it resembles the regular flow of a
torrent, but when it reaches the sixth line it comes to a climax as
if the torrent had become a beautiful waterfall. Or to use another
simile. The first part of it resembles the Atlantic waves as they
roll majestically to the shore, rolling and rolling along with a good
deal of monotony till at length they reach the climax, when they
break forth with a tremendous crash like rolling thunder. Were
there a few individuals who could sing it together till they reached
the sixth line, and then the whole to unite with them, there would
be such singing as I have seldom listened to.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although all the masons in the world were to go on hammering at the
English for a century, they could not make it rhyme like the Gaelic
in this verse. I have composed a considerable number of poems.
I suppose, when published together, they will form the largest collection
in the language. I attempted to translate two or three of
them, but found it impossible to do so by strictly following the
rules of English versification. I attempted to translate more, but
found I could not translate one verse to my satisfaction, and I
wish that scholars would understand this—that it is utterly impossible
to give them anything like a correct idea of our poetry,
unless we are allowed to follow the Gaelic rules of versification, and
even with that licence we cannot come up to it. I saw in a periodical
a review of the lyric poetry of Wales, which showed that it
was impossible to give a proper expression of it in an English
translation. The same is equally true of the Gaelic. The strict
rules to which he is tied down who would attempt to compose
English verse prevent him from soaring like the eagle, and his productions
must be comparatively tame, and awanting in energy.</p>

<p>Singing has a mighty power over the human mind, which the
church to a great extent has neglected, and a power which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
she never wields aright but when in a revived state. I once went
into a house; but the moment I entered, the youngsters, some of
them men and women, all fled. “See,” said the mother, (a pious
woman), “how they have all gone.” “Yes,” I said, “but we’ll soon
bring them back,” and so commenced to sing a poem, not to the
tunes of Martyrdom or Oldham (these would not bring them back),
but to the tune, “Whistle o’er the lave o’t,” and they all returned
immediately.</p>

<p>How shrewd the remark, “Give me the songs of a nation, and I
care not who gives them laws.” It has been stated that the poems
of the great reformer, sung to the native melodies of Germany, had
a greater effect in promoting the Reformation than all his writings.
I have heard melodies, but any that come up to our native melodies,
both Highland and Lowland, I have not heard. If the songs of
our country, many of them, have such a bad effect, and the melodies
so sweet and fascinating, why not regenerate the song? By so
doing the instrument would be wrested from the hands of the
enemy; the sword taken from the great Goliath to cut off his own
head, and to destroy the Philistines. In this respect we are in
advance of our neighbours; our songs to a considerable extent
are regenerated already. Dugald Buchanan’s Poems I place first,
being superior to any that has appeared yet, so far as poetry is
concerned. Duncan M’Dougall, a native of Mull, but ultimately
residing in Tiree, has a considerable number, I suppose, with the
exception of Peter Grant, the largest collection we have. His
poems are good, most of them sung to the airs most common in
Tiree and Mull. Daniel Grant, a native of Strathspey, but residing
in Athol, comes next to M’Dougall in point of number, and although
he is not his superior either as a Gaelic scholar or as a poet,
he is his superior for conveying real spiritual instruction to the
mind. He has picked up some of the airs in Athol and Strathspey,
and even some from the low country. Donald Henry, I believe,
a native of Arran, has also left some very sweet poems, of which
many are very fond. J. Morrison, Harris, was an extraordinary genius.
His language is superior to Dugald Buchanan, and is not his inferior
as a poet. He had more of the language of the Highland bards
that puffs up. Dugald had nothing of that, but was powerful in
his simplicity. The former resembles David clad in Saul’s armour,
the latter David with the sling and the stones. In singing Morrison’s
we cannot but think of the bard, but in singing Dugald’s he
is not thought of at all, and almost every word tells. Dr M’Donald
has left a considerable number of poems; some of them are elegies.
He was certainly the most powerful preacher in the Highlands in
his time, and anything said in his praise is superfluous, as it is all
over the Highlands. Yet it strikes me that he did not shine so
much as a poet as he did as a preacher. His poetry is certainly
good, but there is nothing extraordinary about it, as there is about
his preaching. “The Christian on the Banks of Jordan” is excellent,
and very expressive; but there are some pieces of his containing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
his own views of disputed points of doctrine, with an evident
intention to give a hit at those who differed from him, which are
not suitable for being sung in the praises of God. Songs of praise
should be for the whole church. No doubt he considered those
opposed to him as holding error, but they consider that he holds
error too, and how is the matter to be settled? Is it not possible
to hold the doctrine of election, and at the same time to hold that,
in a certain sense, Christ died for all men? Is it not possible to
lay the blame at the sinner’s door, where it shall be left at the last
day, without denying the necessity of Divine influence in his conversion?</p>

<p>I come now to my great favourite, M’Gregor. Buchanan was
his superior as one of nature’s poets, and perhaps his superior in
point of style. He did not show so much of the scholar. The
scholar seen in lyric poetry, instead of adding to it, rather detracts
from it. But, notwithstanding, M’Gregor was his superior by far
as a theologian for bringing varied and important truths before the
mind. I have seen many a book, but a book of its size which contains
more important truth I have never seen. Every truth that is
important for the Christian to know is systematically laid down;
every poem is like a well-composed discourse, the subject experimentally
handled in all its bearings; and all that in language excellent,
in versification perfect, and suited to be sung to some of
the most beautiful melodies of our country. I have never quarrelled
with a single idea, a single word, a single line. There is not a
book in existence, apart from the Bible, from which I have derived
more benefit to my soul. Every one knows what a hold a truth
sung takes of the mind. I am sorry for the tame manner in which
these poems are recommended in their introduction, as if Dr
M’Gregor was nothing but a mere imitator of the poets. How
ridiculous! Did not these poets imitate those who went before them,
taking the measure of their verses from them. I am also sorry to
see some of his pieces sadly disfigured and maimed in the last edition,
especially his poem on the judgment. He must indeed have
had a very high opinion of himself, the man that would come after
Dr M’Gregor and endeavour to improve his versification.</p>

<p>I come now to <i>Grant’s Poems</i>, which is the largest collection we
have. His melodies are delicious; and no wonder, they are from
the land of melody. The finest melodies in Scotland are called
strathspeys. I believe that <i>Grant’s Poems</i> and the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>
have done as much good in the Highlands as any publications
that have been circulated among them, apart from the Bible. They
are extraordinary for their simplicity. There is not only milk for
babes in abundance, but also strong meat for men. His “Glory of
the Lamb” is splendid, and his “Love Song” is beautiful. Were
these poems to pass through the hands of Archd. Sinclair, printer,
62 Argyle Street, Glasgow, they would be greatly improved. He
is a good Gaelic scholar, and one of the best printers of that language
in Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to our neighbours. Is it to be
credited that, in the year of our Lord, 1868, Christian Scotland,
the land of creeds, bibles, ministers, churches, and Sabbath schools,
has still nothing to play on their instruments of music but the old
unregenerate songs of their country? They are so very orthodox,
not only in their creeds, but also in their language and melodies,
that they would look upon hymns composed in broad Scotch and
sung to their native melodies as a kind of heresy not to be tolerated.
Scotsmen have generally as much shrewdness, sagacity, and common
sense as any people on the face of the earth. To call such blockheads
would be considered the greatest falsehood that ever came
from the lips of man. But consider what they have done. They
have renounced their own language, which is a natural language,
and the language of their nature, and their native melodies, which
are the melodies of their nature. They have turned their backs
on them. They have rejected their own; and what have they
chosen in their place? An artificial language and artificial
melodies quite foreign to their nature. Had Robert Burns as many
hard consonants on his tongue as an Englishman has, he never would
have set his country in a <i>lowe</i> with his sweet melodies as he hath
done. It has been remarked that England has no national melodies.
Is that to be wondered at? England has no language for
melody. The crows have no melody; and before they can have
any, they would require either to get another language, or to send
up a Scotchwoman amongst them to add her affectionate <i>ie</i> to it,
which would give it beautiful melody. <i>Gira-ie</i>, which would sound
something like our <i>ghraidh</i>, the vocative of <i>gradh</i> (love).</p>

<p>Let any person say, “My wee bonnie lammie;” let him continue
doing so, placing the accent upon one word after another, and
while he continues doing so, a sweet melody proceeds from his lips,
which is the melody of nature, as if he held a tinkling bell in his
hand. But let him say, “My little pretty lamb,” and the melody
ceases, as if he struck the bell flat upon the table, and held nothing
but a piece of cork in his hand. It is true that the English may
be covered over with a tinsel of artificial melody, but what will be
its effect? Will it affect the Scottish mind like its native melodies?
These have seized the Scottish heart; have ingratiated themselves
with the very feelings and nature of Scotsmen, which makes them
their own natural melodies as much as the melody of larks and
nightingales is their own.</p>

<p>I heard two females, beautiful singers, singing some revival
hymns, one of them a very tame piece of lyric poetry; while singing
it, they were in raptures about it. Now, I am certain it was
the bursts of artificial melody that put them in raptures. It was
the sound of their own voices, and not what they were singing, that
affected them. They were puffed up with a puff of empty air, so
that, in listening to them, I was led to put the question, What is
all that noise about?</p>

<p>Now, I am convinced that were that masterpiece of lyric poetry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
“Scots wha hae,” with the child’s simplicity, but the giant’s grasp
in seizing the Scotch heart, to be sung to a regiment of Scotch
warriors, or even played on the Highland Bagpipe in approaching
the front of battle’s lower; the question, “What is all that noise
about?” would be answered by their daring feats in the field of
strife. And I put it to the good sense, and to the enlightened
mind of Scottish Christianity—were there a piece composed in
broad Scotch, as much calculated to fire the soul of the Christian
warrior, as the other is calculated to fire the soul of the Scottish
warrior, and sung to the same tune, what would be its blessed effect?
Would it not put all their Anthems, their Old Hundreds, their
artificial, their drawling slow march melodies entirely into the shade?</p>

<p>But our neighbours are so sensitive and have such fine and
delicate feelings, that the vulgarity of the broad Scotch, and the
associations connected with Scottish melodies, make them shrink
back as the patient would shrink back from the surgeon’s knife.
I was in a place of worship on one occasion, where a few individuals
commenced to sing a Revival Hymn to the air of “Annie
Laurie;” a grave Deacon rose from his seat and silenced them,
stating that he could not bear the associations of that tune. I
declare “Annie Laurie” was the most beautiful singer I heard
amongst them; and as that was the first time I heard her voice, I
would like to hear it again. If I could I would pick it up, and do
with it as I have done with other pearls which as swine they are
trampling under their feet. The late Mr Campbell, Oban, who had
a fine ear for music, had a servant girl from Uist who was a beautiful
singer; she was constantly singing a love song she had learned.
The sweet melody of the piece caught the ear of the saint, and
soon became his own; the words began to pour in also, and what
could he do? The air he could not hate, but how to keep it without
keeping the words along with it was the difficulty. He however
fell on a plan; he went into his study, took his pen and wrote
down some verses suited to the air. In his circumstances did he
not do the best thing he could do? Let our neighbours follow his
example. Sounds take a long time in coming. It is a long time
since the sound was heard from Rowland Hill’s lips—“What a
pity that the devil should have the prettiest tunes.” These words
have at last found a response in the bosom of a Highlander, which
he returns as from the rocky mountains of his country, saying—“The
devil shall not have the prettiest tunes.” That again to
find a response in rocky Wales, louder and louder still—“The devil
shall not have the prettiest tunes,” and like the sound of thunder
rolling and rolling over the United Kingdom, finding a response in
all Churches and Chapels as it rolls along.</p>

<p>Have we not our associations in the Highlands as well as they?
Two of the finest pieces we sing, Grant’s “Glory of the Lamb,”
and M’Gregor’s “Righteousness of Christ,” we sing to the air of
that song which Duncan Ban M’Intyre composed to his spouse (a
piece of lyric poetry that the English can never imitate), and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
singing them we never think that there was such a woman as
Mhairi bhan òg in existence. The Scottish people prove that they
find a sweetness in their native melodies, which they do not find in
others. At their soirees do they not as it were cross over their
fences in search of them? How ridiculous at the soirees of Christian
Churches to hear “Scots wha hae,” “Ochone, Widow Machree,”
and such like pieces sung. What vulgar beings they are to be sure!</p>

<p>I had a strong prejudice for the most part of my life against the
broad Scotch. I looked upon it as I would from an eminence look
down upon a number of tinkers and <i>donkeys</i> below me. I saw
a <i>Magazine</i> several years ago, which contained two pieces of
poetry on opposite columns. The one was composed with all the
power of the mistress of arts in pure English, and the other in
the artless simplicity of the broad Scotch. The title of the former,
if I recollect well, was “The Houseless Children;” that of the latter
“There’s nae room for twa.” I read the former, and it did not
awaken a single emotion in my soul; I began to suspect I was not
scholar enough to comprehend it: the title was the most moving of
the whole. I read the other piece, and it almost set me a dancing,
and perhaps, had I only been twenty-five years of age, I would
have risen up and danced the Highland Fling. The piece gives an
account of a Jamie, and of a Katie, and a Janet who were in love
with him. When crossing over a very narrow bridge, Jamie said,
“Janet must walk behind, there’s nae room for twa.” Jamie’s
words, “There’s nae room for twa,” went to Janet’s heart. The
result was that Katie was his bride, and while the sun shone upon
her, poor Janet was left under the dark clouds. She, however,
began to bethink herself, and said—</p>

<p>Can the English language produce such a piece of artless simplicity,
so natural, so touching, and so telling! No, never. The only
fault that I could find with it, is, that there is some of it broader
than the broad Scotch itself. I am not aware that “sheen” is ever
used for “seen;” and I am not sure that it is strictly true, that there
is nae room for twa in the grave to which we all must go. That’s
a piece I would recommend to be sung at soirees; it will sing nicely
to the air, “There’s nae luck aboot the house.” I was so delighted
with the last verse, that I composed a poem in Gaelic on the same
subject, suited to the same air.</p>

<p>Let us now bid <i>farewell</i> to our neighbours, leaving them to bake
their own cakes the best way they can, and let us retrace our steps
to the land of our birth, and to the language of our nature; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
in doing so, let me put a question to those who would wish to do
away with our native language; can you supply us with a better
language for our homes? I defy you. Is there a language upon
earth by which our youth can attain the knowledge of God as the
author of the great salvation, so readily and with so little trouble
and expense, as through the medium of their own native Gaelic?
What then shall we say to those parents and to those who have
the management of our Schools in the Highlands, who do not teach
our youth to read it and to understand it better? I have no hesitation
in declaring that they were guilty of a very great crime—of
an act of cruelty towards our youth, and of an act of rebellion
against God. If God has given a revelation to men, he has appointed
the Gaelic to the Highlanders, as the proper medium for
obtaining the knowledge of that revelation; and how dare men in
their shallow wisdom act towards Highlanders contrary to God’s
appointed method of instructing them. The great stumbling-block
with ministers, schoolmasters, and proprietors in the Highlands, is,
that they do not consider the Gaelic genteel and fashionable, and
do not put themselves to the trouble of studying it. I know no
study that would repay better than the study of the Gaelic. It is
not such a dry, such a complicated affair at all as the study of the
English. In studying the Gaelic a man finds himself as among the
living, but in studying the English as among the dead. In studying
the former he finds himself as it were at home, in studying the
latter as among foreigners. The more I study the Gaelic, the more
I admire it, and the more am I astonished at the refined imagination
which our forefathers had. I have no fears of the Gaelic because
it has God for its author. I have no fears of it, because I believe
that the spark is still alive in my countrymen which can be kindled
into a flame.</p>

<p>When a boy, and at the end of our house (slated, substantially
built, two-storey high) and raising my voice, every word that I
spoke was repeated by the house. I had a younger brother, who
was a great mimic, and thought he was mocking me; so I turned
about and addressed the supposed brother: “If you’ll take my
advice you’ll be quiet.” “If you’ll take my advice you’ll be quiet,”
instantly replied the mimicking brother. “I tell you again to hold
your tongue.” “I tell you again to hold your tongue,” as quickly
replied. “If you’ll not be quiet I’ll thrash you,” was as quick as
lightning repeated. So having spent all my threats, and becoming
more and more furious, the mimicking brother becoming equally so,
I had at last to desist, being fairly mastered; he on my top, in spite
of me. Now I am certain that were I to cry “Shame, shame,” or the
more expressive Gaelic, “<i>Mo naire, mo naire</i>” (my shame, my shame),
it would with equal distinctness be repeated by the house. So I
would have all the Highlanders, from John o’ Groat’s to the Mull of
Kintyre, and from Dunkeld to the Butt of Lewes and Cape Wrath,
to raise their voices, and, with the strength of their lungs, to cry out
“<i>Mo naire, mo naire</i>,” to those parents, those native proprietors,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
and those ministers and schoolmasters who wish to do away with
the Gaelic by not teaching them to read it, so as to make all their
castles, palaces, mansions, manses, school-houses, and dwelling-houses
to resound “<i>Mo naire, mo naire</i>,” with such a terrific rattling
noise as to startle the whole of them out of their houses; and seeing
them still standing, each to address the troublesome noise, “<i>Mo
naire</i>”—“If you’ll take my advice you’ll be quiet.” “If you’ll take
my advice you’ll be quiet,” quickly repeated. “I tell you again to
hold your tongue.” “I tell you again to hold your tongue,” instantly
repeated. “If you’ll not be quiet I’ll thrash you.” “If
you’ll not be quiet I’ll thrash you,” still repeated; and becoming
more and more furious, the mimicking something becoming equally
so, one and all of them be forced to give way, being fairly mastered,
with the hearty Highlanders on their top.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2>CATECHISM.</h2>

<p>A Catechism on the first principles of Divine teaching both by
nature and revelation:—</p>

<p>Who are the two great teachers of mankind?—Nature and
Revelation.</p>

<p>Who is the author of both?—The great God.</p>

<p>Is the teaching of both unerring or inspired?—Yes; because
God is their author.</p>

<p>Is the teaching of both in anything opposed the one to the other?—In
nothing, and cannot be so, because they have the same God
as their author.</p>

<p>How ought the teaching of both to be received?—With an
humble, teachable disposition of mind.</p>

<p>Does God teach the animal species?—Yes; he teaches them by
putting what is called natural instincts in them.</p>

<p>Seeing that the human species have not only an animal body but
also a rational soul, how does God teach them?—He teaches them
by nature and revelation.</p>

<p>How does God teach them by nature? He teaches them by
nature, by putting natural instincts in them, though not to the same
extent as in animals.</p>

<p>How does God teach them by revelation?—By putting spiritual
instincts in them. The unconverted have no spiritual instincts, are
entirely influenced by a depraved nature, under the power of sin and
Satan. But when God teaches them, he destroys the power of sin,
puts spiritual instincts in them; they get an unction from the Holy
One. The spiritual instincts of the converted differ as much from
those of the unconverted as the natural instincts of the sheep differ
from those of the wolf.</p>

<p>The same God who by instinct taught the ewe and the moor-hen
to love their young and to care for them; the same God by instinct
has taught the mother to love her child and to care for it. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
as the same God by instinct has taught the former a language to
express their kindness which by instinct their young can comprehend;
so in like manner he has taught a language to mothers to express
their kindness, which the instinct and ultimately the reason of their
offspring can comprehend. The native languages of the Highlands
and Lowlands are as much the languages of nature, of what nature
taught them, as the bleating of sheep or the lowing of cattle.
God has given the best languages to beasts and birds that could
be given to them. The Gaelic (and I say the same of the broad
Scotch) is the best that could be given to Highlanders in all the
relations of life, and for keeping them a united, a happy, and a
contented people. Yes, and the best medium for conveying the
knowledge of God our Saviour to their minds. This, then, is the
language which a gracious God in great kindness gave unto them.</p>

<p>But there is another great being—man—who frequently sets
himself up in opposition to the great God, as if he were wiser and
disposed to be kinder than what he is. He also must give a
language of his own making, which he has made up in a great
measure from dead languages. He looks upon his own language
as greatly superior to theirs—more learned, more refined, more
respectable, and more genteel. Sets his extraordinary machinery
agoing, gets schools and schoolmasters established all over the
kingdom to teach, not one word of the languages which God
taught the people, but his own; gives prizes to his scholars, and
rewards the best of them by giving them honorary titles—Bachelor
of Arts, and Master of Arts, &amp;c.—puffing them up to the very
skies. Thus the artificial English comes in direct opposition to the
native languages of the country, calling them vulgar. God their
author might as well be called so.</p>

<p>It comes and ingratiates itself with the pride and the vanity of
the higher class of society. They were too high before, but it gives
them their heart’s desire, it exalts them to the very clouds. It
comes, and instead of bringing a blessing in its train, brings a curse;
instead of regenerating, actually degenerates society. It found
people united—the rich and the poor, the high and the low—in a
society of brotherhood, knit together by the same language. The
Highlanders by their Gaelic and the Lowlanders by their broad
Scotch, living together in mutual friendship, the one looking upon
the other’s language as that which the God of nature taught them.
But the great man comes with his pure English and snaps the link
in the chain asunder that united the rich and the poor, the high and
the low together—puts a complete separation between them—removes
the former from the common brotherhood, and exalting them
as high above their heads as if they were a race of foreigners and
not of the same species at all. There is your handiwork, proud
man, who would be as gods. Those who have received the
language you have prepared for them are exalted, many of them,
above common mortals, as if they were gods. Yet they shall die
like men. Both parties are injured, but especially the Englified, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
genteel, and the fashionable. They are puffed up with pride—filled
with a vain conceit of their own superiority—their feelings of affection
are dried up, being so far removed from the commonality as
to have no sympathy with them. The others are injured also,
being disheartened and discouraged from a conviction and a feeling
of shame arising from it, that they are despised and treated
with disrespect. This was not the case in former times. I knew
proprietors in my younger days who not only spoke the Gaelic, but
spoke it even better than the common people, and who, when they
spoke English, spoke it in broad Scotch. At that time they were
the men of the people, standing on a common level with them as
regarded the language, and entered into their feelings. But how
is the case now? All the answer that I will give to the question
is, “God be merceful to my countrymen when foreigners are their
proprietors!” Who has produced the melancholy change? Has it
been brought about by God’s teaching, either by nature or revelation?
Not at all; it is the doing of vain man, by introducing his
artificial language. Is it not possible for men to receive all the
benefits from the English which it is calculated to give without
renouncing their own language and choosing it as the language of
society.</p>

<p>Nature’s teaching and man’s teaching come contrary, the one to
the other, in another respect. Nature teaches a beautiful variety,
but the master of arts a dull uniformity. I have already referred
to the beautiful varieties of the Gaelic, as spoken in the different
parts of the Highlands. There is also the same variety in the
different counties where the broad Scotch is spoken; but the
master of arts comes with his artificial English, and with its rolling
waves disfigures and spoils the whole, and leaves nothing but his
own dull uniformity on their ruins. I believe that the time has
come when God, as the great author of nature, and consequently
as the author of the native languages of Scotland, shall say to the
proud waves of man’s language, “Hitherto shalt thou come and no
farther,” and “Here shall thy proud waves be stayed.” May all
hearty Highlanders and all hearty Scotchmen say, “Amen, God grant
it.” The great man does not duly set himself against the great God
by going to the languages of nature and bringing a language out
of them, which he sets up in opposition to the native languages as
better and more genteel, but he must set himself up in opposition
to Him likewise, as if he were wiser than he, by going to the
other fountain of God’s teaching, Revelation, and bringing a creed
and confession out of it, to be set up as the best and the most
fashionable, and brands as a heretic every man who would differ
from him. What do all the denominations of Christians attempt
but to bring a creed and a confession out of Revelation as a bond
of union and uniformity. But nature teaches a very different
lesson. It teaches union and not uniformity, but union and variety.
It teaches it in the human countenance, the human race, in trees
and plants, four-footed clean animals, clean birds; in the Gaelic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
broad Scotch, and, I am sure, in the French. Revelation teaches
the same—a Trinity in unity. The bond of union amongst Highlanders
is their Gaelic, and still there is no uniformity, but a
beautiful variety. The bond of union amongst Christians is their
Christianity. Christianity cannot exist without Christians. Christian
union cannot exist amongst men without Christianity, and a real
unity cannot exist amongst Christians without a glorious variety.
This lesson nature teaches with perfect inspiration. Let Christians
then treat Christianity as Highlanders treat the Gaelic. Let them
follow their own views of it conscientiously and allow others to
do the same, without attempting to set up their views as a confession
of faith to others. Let the people of God then separate
themselves from the unconverted world, and let this principle of
nature’s Divine teaching be admitted by them, namely, unity and a
glorious variety—unity as it regards the great essentials of
Christianity, and variety as it regards the non-essentials. In that
way, and in that way alone, shall they be properly united; in that
way alone shall they enjoy one another, and, instead of living in
the cold, narrow cell of sectarian selfishness, they will live in the
expansive, the benign, the benevolent region of a glorious variety,
and their minor differences, instead of detracting from, will actually
add to the pleasure, the harmony, and the happiness of the whole.</p>

<p>There is a text which I would give to all the ministers in Scotland
as the subject of their discourse on the first Sabbath of
January, 1869—“Doth not nature itself teach you.”—<i>1 Cor.</i> xi., 14.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the teaching of nature has not been attended
to as it ought. A person properly influenced by it, and humbly
receiving its teaching, is conscious that he is under the guidance
of a safe teacher. I will give one instance of nature’s teaching.
I have two grandchildren in my house, a boy and a girl, about
four years of age, who are very fond of their grandpapa, so
fond that they wish to be oftener with him than he considers
desirable. Should he only request them to go out in the usual
way, they only laugh at him. If he rises to put them out, they
run under the table like kittens. When he is on the one side
they are on the other, where his hand cannot reach them. He
then has to take the strap and threaten them severely and, even
when putting them out with that severity, they put their
backs to the door to prevent him from shutting it, and sometimes
weep bitterly, which is very painful to his feelings. Nature, however,
has taught him a different lesson: to speak kindly to them in
a low tone of voice, and instantly they go out quite happy, and
even saying, “Put the snib on the door, grandpapa.”</p>

<p class="noindent">Although my native country, I am quite ashamed of them. Is the schoolmaster
a Highlander? Was it he who wrote the inscription “<i>Mile failte</i>”
(a thousand welcomes) on the top of the arch on the occasion of a certain
gentleman up the country taking home his English bride? I passed under it,
and expressed my astonishment to see it, as the children spoke nothing but
English on the street. Is the spark still alive in his soul? Is that spark
capable of being enkindled into a flame? <i>A thraill! Na’m bithinn ann ad ait,
bheirinn oidhearp air mo chainnt-mhathaireil a theasairginn, ged a bhiodh i mar an
t-uan ann am fiaclan casgraidh an leomhainn.</i> Ye slave! Were I in your place,
I would endeavour to rescue my mother-tongue, should it be like the lamb in
the devouring teeth of the lion.</p>

stream was <i>an t-alltan</i>, the same as we would say in broad Scotch, the burnie,
that is the small stream. But when the Gaelic ceased to be spoken, and the
broad Scotch came in its place, they called it an t-alltan-burn. Now burn is
taken from the Gaelic word <i>burn</i>, which means water, as the word whisky
is taken from <i>uisge</i> (water), also. In singing this poem, where two, or three,
or four verses are following one another without the chorus, let them be sung
to the same key. It will sing to the air of “<i>Och nan och, ’us och mo leon!</i>”</p>
